## Introduction

**Obana Lettle VSD(2)-65** is a *Victory*-class Star Destroyer built for the Galactic Imperial Navy. The VSD _Obana Lettle_ completed its Class II refit on 37:1:29, extending its anticipated service life for another thirty years. The _Lettle_ has a crew of 5881 service members and is capable of carrying up to 24 fighter craft (in TIE racks); with room for 3 shuttles or several smaller ferry craft.

## History
The keel of the *Obana Lettle* was laid down in 18:6:10 at **Rendili StarDrive**, Rendili. She was launched and commissioned on 20:5:5 with her shakedown cruise taking her up the Hydian way to Listehol, and then over and down the Perlemian Trade Route where she assisted in the pacification of the Keyorin uprisings. 

The *Obana Lettle* saw action in the early years of the Galactic Empire, becoming a namesake of stalwartness and survivability. It suffered near catastrophic damage during the Battle of Palanhi (36:1:12), saved from destruction only by a blind hyperspace hop to the nearby loyalist planet of Mrisst, where it was sheltered until aid arrived. Afterwards, the *Lettle*—as her crew affectionately refer to her—was teamed with the _Vigil_, the dogged Clone Wars battleship for which that ship's class is named. The duo has formed the core of many formidable battleship battle groups since.
